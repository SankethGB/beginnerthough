 ### Boltzmann Machine 
    - It is like you allow a litre of gas in a huge room. Initially its all densely in the place of release. 
      At equilibrium it distrubutes all around the room so as to attain minimum energy state . This explains 
      the working of bolzmann machine.
    -  Restricted Boltzmann Machines are shallow, two-layer neural nets that constitute the building blocks 
       of deep-belief networks. The first layer of the RBM is called the visible, or input layer, and the second 
       is the hidden layer. 
  
   ### Auto Encoder 
    - Hey neural network what if your output is again your input! Would you try to see the patterns....yeah you will.
      So auto encoders are nothing but ANNs with ditto input and output. Rather than terming this unsupervised one can
      say it is Self Supervised Learning.
